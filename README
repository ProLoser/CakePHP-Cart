"One Plugin to rule them all"

This is an attempt to become the defacto solution for shopping cart 
implementation in CakePHP. Not to say this in of itself will be the 
best shopping cart around, but in fact give developers the resource
to build their own custom shopping cart Application to their own
specifications.

Hopefully future versions of the brother development app, 'Mocha'
will use future releases of this plugin as a part of it's core. For
now this is a 1-stop plugin that provides you all the resources you 
need to build a cart and nothing more, allowing you to extrapolate 
from that point forwards.

Pending Features:
 - Potential integration with UsersPlugin under development for 
	Bakery 2.0
 - Shopping cart session component
 - Shopping cart session helper
 - Shipping / Tax handling (feature RFC)
 - Optional base table for standard products
 - Payment gateway behavior
 - Payment gateway api datasources (such as Google checkout and 
	Paypal) that will work through the payment gateway behavior
 - Administration tools, such as mass product uploading/editing
	- Integration with CSV component for custom importing/exporting
